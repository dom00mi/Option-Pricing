# Delta Hedging App

Based on an essential excerpt from my final CQF (Certificate of Quantitative Finance) project which focused on Optimal Delta Hedging in a Dynamic context, I would like to build a simple and easy to deploy Delta Hedging App via [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

> [!NOTE]
For full definitions, please have a look into my Dynamic Delta Hedging Jupiter notebook at the [link](https://github.com/dom00mi/Option-Pricing/blob/main/Delta%20Hedging/Dynamic%20Delta%20Hedging.ipynb). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### How to Use the App?



> 1. Save the files locally in your folder, as an example `C:\Users\Your_Username`.
>
> 2. Asumming that you have installed  [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), please launch Anaconda Prompt in your computer
> 
> 3. Once launched Anaconda, run the following commands: `cd C:\Users\Your_Username` and `streamlit run delta_hedging_app.py`
>
> 4. This will launch a Local URL: http://localhost:8501 where you can run the app.
