# Monte-Carlo-Asian-and-Lookback-Option-Pricer
In this mini-research, I will be attempting to use the Monte Carlo scheme to price exotic options (Asian and lookback options) the risk-neutral density  ùëÑ  . and simulating the asset price process through the Geometric Bronwian Motion SDE in its Euler-Maruyama form.
